10: If the passing object is not an instance of Media, the equals() method will return false because the comparison cannot be performed. The equals() method in the Media class includes a check to ensure that obj belongs to the same class as Media using the getClass() method

11: 
- When we iterate through the list using a for-each loop, the toString() method is called on each Media object. 
- The toString() method is dynamically bound, meaning it is called based on the actual type of the object at runtime. 
- For each media object in the list, the appropriate toString() method of the respective class (Book, DVD, or CompactDisc) is invoked, and the information specific to that type is printed.

            if (this.cost < other.cost) {
