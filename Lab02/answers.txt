If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
- Even though they are functionally different, the above two constructors cannot exist together in the DigitalVideoDisc class because Java only differentiates them based on the method/constructor signature.
